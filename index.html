With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops.</div>

                <div class="description">Multiplayer games bring people together for cooperative or competitive gameplay experiences. Whether teaming up to complete objectives or going head-to-head in epic battles, these games thrive on social interaction. Battle Royale games, a subset of multiplayer, pit dozens or even hundreds of players against one another in survival-style matches until only one player or team remains. Titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, and Apex Legends dominate this category.</div>
